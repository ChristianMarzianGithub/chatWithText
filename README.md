An AI powered application that lets you upload a text and ask questions about it.

## Authentication UI

The header now includes quick access buttons for **Log in** and **Register**. Each button routes to a dedicated page featuring:

- Email/password forms that will connect to the future `/login` and `/register` REST endpoints.
- Social login placeholders for Google, GitHub, and Microsoft.
- A "stay logged in" option so users can persist their sessions once the backend integration is wired up.

These screens are fully responsive and ready for API integration.
